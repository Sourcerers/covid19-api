# COVID-19 DATA API

This API provides information about Coronavirus disease, from several reliable sources, like Johns Hopkins CSSE, CDC, WHO and a few others. All sources are trusted, and there is no information that is not confirmed by official authorities. Every country sends official reports differently. From once per day to every hour. That depends on the scale of pandemic and timezone.
